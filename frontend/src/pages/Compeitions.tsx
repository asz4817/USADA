      Dear US Diabolo Players, <br/><br/>

      We are excited to announce an event that will rally diabolo players from all over the United States. We invite you to join us at the second USA National Diabolo Competition! The competition will offer individuals and teams the opportunity to show off their abilities.
      <br /> <br />

      For years, we have dreamed of a large event for diabolo players in the US to come together. Our goal is to foster connections between community members from all over the country. Whether you are competing or not, we hope that you join us in August. 
      <br /> <br />

      Sincerely, <br/> <br />
      The USA Diabolo Association
      </p>
