        <p>
            For those flying in from out of state, we recommend flying into Newark Liberty International Airport. The competition venue (Sportsplex at Metuchen) is roughly a 25 minute drive from Newark Airport. An alternative option would be to fly into New York JFK International Airport which is roughly a 1 hour drive to the venue. <br/>
            Limited public transportation is available between Newark Liberty Airport and the venue.

            We have secured a group rate of $139 + taxes and fees per night per room for August 1st and August 2nd at the Crowne Plaza Edison. The hotel is less than a 10-minute drive from the venue and is conveniently located around various restaurants and shopping malls in the area. We highly encourage competitors to book at the hotel listed as you will be able to socialize with other competitors during non-competition hours. Additionally, we may be hosting informal social events & gatherings at the hotel during the night.
